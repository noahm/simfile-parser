# notes on handling smx charts in ssc

## rolls

instead of 2 starting a hold, 4 starts a roll. still looks for a 3 to end it just like a regular hold

## metered rolls

no idea? maybe something to do with the D notation? (adds an extra value)

## Lifts!

uses L notation but unclear how they fit in with holds

## mine pits

maybe DM?

## the D

seems to be a modifier for the next character

### DM

indicates the start of a mine pit,
ended by 3 as usual

### DL

indicates a "tail lift" ending a hold
