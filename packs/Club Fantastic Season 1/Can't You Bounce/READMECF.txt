the In The Groove scene for over a decade.

Recommendations On Derived Works, Bundling, and Tournament Packs
================================================================

When bundling Club Fantastic content, the authors would appreciate
observing the following recommendations when possible, unless
there is a very good reason for not doing so.

When possible, please:

- Retain the original Club Fantastic art for each song.
  A common practice for tournament packs is to remove song art.
  Please consider that the musicians, artists and CF authors
  took great care to compile the work as a cohesive whole.
- Include this README.TXT file in each song folder
- Leave all step difficulties in derived files

Thank you for using Club Fantastic tracks in your tournament!
